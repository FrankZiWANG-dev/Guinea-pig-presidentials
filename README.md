## Project
This "pet" project of mine is a simple website showing off my guinea pigs.
Visitors can vote (once per person) for their favorite, and see who is the crowd favorite so far.
There's also a contact form.

## Technologies
The backend is in PHP, with a MySQL database.
The frontend is in HTML and SASS.
The website is responsive.
